           <h4> Hello and welcome to my instructional design portfolio!</h4>
           In addition to providing you with examples of my instructional design work, this site also serves to demonstrate my competencies in using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. It was built on a template created by the CollectionBuilder team, but predominantly represents my own document design work.
