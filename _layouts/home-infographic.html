      <h4 id="question-1">Question 1:</h4> <h5>How might you use a digital portfolio? What purpose do you want it to serve?</h5></p>
      <p class="py-2" style="width=75ch;">
      A digital portfolio is something that can be shared along with a resume and cover letter as a way of demonstrating competencies related to a particular concept or task.
      It offers a space where you can show projects that you have worked on rather than just describing them verbally.
      I would like my portfolio to serve as a space where I can document my journey through the ID certificate and to act as a tool I can use in the future to complement my CV.
      </p>
     
    <h4 id="question-2">Question 2:</h4> <h5>What audience do you have in mind for your portfolio?</h5>
      <p class="py-2">
      My primary audience would be future employers, but I would also be interested in being able to use this as a reflective document to see how my design style changes over time!
    </p>
 
    <h4 id="question-3">Question 3:</h4> <h5>What elements/content, might you want to include in your portfolio? If you already have a portfolio, what have you been inspired to add or change about yours after viewing the sample portfolios? </h5>
           <p class="py-2">
      In the past, I have used websites/portfolios to document technical processes and I find that very useful for being able to refer to later on. Given this class's focus on accessibility, it might be interesting to include documentation of how I achieve certain looks/elements that promote accessibility so that I can use them in future situations.
  </p>

    <h4 id="question-4">Question 4:</h4> <h5>What preliminary design ideas do you have in mind for your portfolio? Your ideas could include typography, color, images, or layout.</h5>
<p class="py-2">
      I would definitely be interested in playing around with layout, as I typically rely on a standard html sheet or copy from previous designs. Incorporating carousels and other image sharing features might be interesting, but I would want to learn more about how to make them as friendly to screen readers as possible. I have some familiarity with ARIA tags, but not extensive knowledge of how to incorporate them.

<li>Maximum paragraph width was adjusted to 75 characters per the recommendations of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/">Moran (2016)</a>.<br></li>
<li>Line spacing was increased across the site from 1.4 to 2x to create a more comfortable read (see <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/typography-tips/">Jones (2015)</a>).</li>
      <li>Increased spacing between questions to create more effective chunks (see Moran (2016)).</li>
      <li>Added a table of contents because of the increased length of the page.</li>
<li>Per the recommendations of <a href="https://mrwweb.com/no-justification-dont-use-right-center-and-full-justification-on-the-web/">Root-Wiley (2015)</a>, the justification of the 'About' page was changed from centre justification in order to align with the rest of the site. This also helps maintain consistency and create a repetitive form for the site.</li>
