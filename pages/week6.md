## Introduction

#### Question 1:
##### How might you use a digital portfolio? What purpose do you want it to serve?

A digital portfolio is something that can be shared along with a resume and cover letter as a way of demonstrating competencies related to a particular concept or task.
It offers a space where you can show projects that you have worked on rather than just describing them verbally.
I would like my portfolio to serve as a space where I can document my journey through the ID certificate and to act as a tool I can use in the future to complement my CV.



#### Question 2:
##### What audience do you have in mind for your portfolio?
My primary audience would be future employers, but I would also be interested in being able to use this as a reflective document to see how my design style changes over time!



#### Question 3:
##### What elements/content, might you want to include in your portfolio? If you already have a portfolio, what have you been inspired to add or change about yours after viewing the sample portfolios?
      
In the past, I have used websites/portfolios to document technical processes and I find that very useful for being able to refer to later on. Given this class's focus on accessibility, it might be interesting to include documentation of how I achieve certain looks/elements that promote accessibility so that I can use them in future situations.



#### Question 4:
##### What preliminary design ideas do you have in mind for your portfolio? Your ideas could include typography, color, images, or layout.
I would definitely be interested in playing around with layout, as I typically rely on a standard html sheet or copy from previous designs. Incorporating carousels and other image sharing features might be interesting, but I would want to learn more about how to make them as friendly to screen readers as possible. I have some familiarity with ARIA tags, but not extensive knowledge of how to incorporate them.
