## Research Instrument Design
 
#### Project: Master's Thesis
 
Under the supervision of my committee, I designed and used a variety of documents that facilitated my research. What follows is an example of one of these documents, which was approved for use in my research by the UBC Ethics Review Board in November of 2021.

## Instructional Presentations

#### Project: The Joint Secretariat File Name Convention

As part of a work experience project, I scripted and recorded an instructional video explaining the purpose and importance of a standardized file naming convention. The video includes a demonstration of how to implement the file naming convention that was designed by the records management team for the Joint Secretariat.

## Extra Curriculars

In addition to the documents that I create for work, I am an avid hobbyist photographer. Below are some examples of the photos that I have taken.
