{% include feature/nav-menu.html sections="Question 1;Question 2;Question 3;Question 4;Week 7 Changes" %}

#### Question 1:
##### How might you use a digital portfolio? What purpose do you want it to serve?

A digital portfolio is something that can be shared along with a resume and cover letter as a way of demonstrating<br>
 competencies related to a particular concept or task. It offers a space where you can show projects that you have<br>
 worked on rather than just describing them verbally. I would like my portfolio to serve as a space where I can document<br>
 my journey through the ID certificate and to act as a tool I can use in the future to complement my CV.



#### Question 2:
##### What audience do you have in mind for your portfolio?
My primary audience would be future employers, but I would also be interested in being able to use this as a reflective<br>
document to see how my design style changes over time!



#### Question 3:
##### What elements/content, might you want to include in your portfolio? If you already have a portfolio, what have you been inspired to add or change about yours after viewing the sample portfolios?
      
In the past, I have used websites/portfolios to document technical processes and I find that very useful for being able to<br>
refer to later on. Given this class's focus on accessibility, it might be interesting to include documentation of how I<br>
achieve certain looks/elements that promote accessibility so that I can use them in future situations.



#### Question 4:
##### What preliminary design ideas do you have in mind for your portfolio? Your ideas could include typography, color, images, or layout.
I would definitely be interested in playing around with layout, as I typically rely on a standard html sheet or copy from <br>
previous designs. Incorporating carousels and other image sharing features might be interesting, but I would want to <br>
learn more about how to make them as friendly to screen readers as possible. I have some familiarity with ARIA tags, <br>
but not extensive knowledge of how to incorporate them.

#### Week 7 Changes

1. Maximum paragraph width was adjusted to 75 characters per the recommendations of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/">Moran (2016)</a>.
2. Line spacing was increased across the site from 1.4 to 2x to create a more comfortable read (see <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/typography-tips/">Jones (2015)</a>).
3. Increased spacing between questions to create more effective chunks (see Moran (2016)).
4. Added a table of contents because of the increased length of the page.
5. Per the recommendations of <a href="https://mrwweb.com/no-justification-dont-use-right-center-and-full-justification-on-the-web/">Root-Wiley (2015)</a>, the justification of the 'About' page was changed from centre <br> justification in order to align with the rest of the site. This also helps maintain consistency and create a repetitive <br> form for the site.
